**Task - 1** : **House Price Prediction**

**Overview**

This repository contains a house price prediction project that uses machine learning models to predict house prices. The project explores the use of different regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, to determine which model performs best for this specific task.

**Project Contents**

* Data: The dataset used for this project is included in the repository. It contains information about various features of houses and their corresponding sale prices.
* Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
* Results (accuracy):
  * Linear Regression : Clearly the model underfits.
  * Decision Tree Regressor :
     * Train R2-score: 99.98 %
     * Test R2-score: 93.16 %
  * Random Forest Regressor :
    *  Train R2-score: 98.36 %
    * Test R2-score: 94.22 %

**Task - 2** : **Retail store customers' grouping based on their purchase history**

**Overview**

This project focuses on customer segmentation for a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to group customers with similar shopping behaviors together using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By understanding customer segments, the retail store can tailor marketing strategies and services to cater to the distinct needs and preferences of different customer groups.

**Project Contents**

* Data: The dataset used in this project, containing customer purchase history and relevant features, is included in the repository.
* Results: This section provides insights and visualizations to showcase the identified customer segments and their characteristics.
* Key Outcomes:
  * Annual Income vs Spending Score Plot: This plot highlights customer behavior based on Annual Income and Spending Score:
    * High-Income, High-Spenders: Top-tier customers.
    * High-Income, Low-Spenders: Marketing optimization potential.
    * Low-Income, High-Spenders: Price-sensitive opportunities.
    * Low-Income, Low-Spenders: Focus on cost-effective retention.
   
  * Age vs Spending Score Plot: This plot showcases how customer age correlates with their spending score, revealing key insights:
    * Young High-Spenders: Young customers with high spending scores; potential for youth-focused marketing.
    * Middle-Aged Shoppers: Customers in their prime shopping years; opportunities for loyalty programs.
    * Senior Frugal Shoppers: Older customers with lower spending scores; consider tailored promotions.
    * Senior High-Spenders: Seniors who still spend generously; create special offerings.
